# **Social Links Profile**

![Design preview](images/preview.jpg)

This repository contains my solution for the **Frontend Mentor - Social Links Profile Challenge**. The challenge focuses on creating a responsive and accessible profile card featuring social links with interactive hover and focus states. The project is built using semantic HTML, modern CSS techniques, SCSS for efficient styling, and JavaScript for dynamic content rendering.

## **üîÑ Refactoring Details**

The project has been successfully refactored to improve maintainability and reusability:

1. **Componentized Buttons**: The `<li>` elements have been refactored into a reusable button component dynamically generated via JavaScript:

   ```javascript
   function createSocialButton(href, label) {
     const li = document.createElement("li");
     li.classList.add("button");

     const a = document.createElement("a");
     a.href = href;
     a.target = "_blank";
     a.rel = "noopener noreferrer";
     a.textContent = label;

     li.appendChild(a);
     return li;
   }
   ```

2. **Dynamic Data Handling**: Dynamic data injection for `href` and `label` was implemented using reusable templates in JavaScript, reducing redundancy and improving scalability.
