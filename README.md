## üîÑ Refactoring Plan

To improve maintainability, I plan to:

- Refactor the `<li>` button code into a reusable HTML component.
- Create a SCSS mixin for button styling to ensure consistent styles across all buttons.
- Example refactored component:

  ```html
  <li class="button">
    <a href="{{ href }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      {{ label }}
    </a>
  </li>
  ```

- Dynamically inject `href` and `label` values through a templating engine or JavaScript.
