```

## **üîÑ Refactoring Details**

The project has been successfully refactored to improve maintainability and reusability:

1. **Componentized Buttons**: The `<li>` elements have been refactored into a reusable button component:

   ```html
   <li class="button">
     <a href="{{ href }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
       {{ label }}
     </a>
   </li>
   ```

   This ensures a cleaner, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) structure.

2. **Dynamic Data Handling**: Dynamic data injection for `href` and `label` was implemented using reusable templates, enhancing flexibility and reducing redundancy.

## **‚ú® Learnings**

- Gained experience with advanced CSS techniques like `:focus-within`, `:hover`, and active states for buttons.
- Enhanced SCSS modularity and styling consistency through the use of variables and nesting.
- Improved understanding of accessibility best practices for navigation, focus management, and semantic HTML structure.
- Successfully refactored repetitive code into reusable components, such as the button implementation, to promote DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and improve maintainability.
